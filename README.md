# Rigidity Processing

This repository contains code used to process rigidity files collected by the Host Microbiome Interaction: Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics research group at King's College London, lead by Dr Sylvia Dobbs, Dr John Dobbs, and Dr Andr'e Charlett. 

The methodology was initially proposed by Dr Clive Weller and written in VBA, which has been converted to Python for improved automation and reliability.
